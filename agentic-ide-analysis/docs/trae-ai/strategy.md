# Strategy for Using Trae AI

Trae AI's strength lies in its combination of a familiar VS Code-based interface with powerful AI features. This makes it a good choice for developers who are looking to get started with AI-powered development without having to learn a new IDE from scratch.

## When to Use Trae AI

*   **Rapid Prototyping:** The "Builder Mode" feature makes Trae a good choice for quickly building prototypes from natural language descriptions.
*   **Frontend Development:** The ability to use images as input for code generation can be a powerful tool for frontend developers.
*   **Learning a New Language or Framework:** The AI-powered assistance can help developers get up to speed quickly on a new language or framework.

## When to Avoid Trae AI

*   **Windows Development:** Trae is not yet available for Windows, so it is not a viable option for developers who are working on that platform.
*   **Large, Complex Projects:** While Trae is a powerful tool, it may not be the best choice for large, complex projects that require a more mature and feature-rich IDE.
